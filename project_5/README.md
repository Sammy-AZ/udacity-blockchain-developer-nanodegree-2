# Udacity Blockchain Developer Nanodegree - Project 5


For this project, you will create a DApp by adding functionality to your smart contract and deploy it on the public testnet. To do so, you'll employ your blockchain identity to secure digital assets on the Ethereum platform using a smart contract. You will get to practice your knowledge of the basics of Solidity.

Previously, you learned to create your own private blockchain web service. In this course, you migrated your private blockchain functionality to a smart contract and created your own ERC721 non-fungible token contract!
